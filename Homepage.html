            <div class = "mediacontent">My name is Luke Hammond, and this is the first website I have ever designed. I am a digital media student at UWE Bristol. This website has been designed for one of my modules, but it is also an experience to test my knowledge and experience with html/css. This website has enabled me to share my work from my module. These pieces of work were done via a variety of Adobe software such as Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop and After Effects.</div>
            <div class = "mediacontent">Down below you can find a download link for my CV as well as links to my social media accounts. This includes my personal Instagram, my Tik Tok account I upload the edits I have made (this account also has a link to my secondary Instagram which also has edits) as well as a link to LinkedIn. </div>
